                How this blog started – I wanted to write about everything that I enjoy or captures my attention. It is
                supposed to consist of every such thing – food, books, life experiences, photography or anything else
                really!

            <h3>Travel</h3>
            <p>I have a passion for all things storytelling. I enjoy telling travel stories through a combination of my
                writing, photography, and videos.</p>

            <h3>Food</h3>
            <p>I used to cook different foods for my friends at work. They started asking for the recipe. That was a
                turning point for me, So i decided to start my very own blog where i can share my recipes.</p>

            <h3>Book</h3>
            <p>I read books primarily to learn, grow, and feed my curiosities. I always feel a sense of satisfaction
                after finishing the three-step process of reading, analysing, and reviewing books for my blog posts.</p>
