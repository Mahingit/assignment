                How this blog started – I wanted to write about everything that I enjoy or captures my attention. It is
                supposed to consist of every such thing – food, books, life experiences, photography or anything else
                really!

            <h3>Travel</h3>
            <p>I have a passion for all things storytelling. I enjoy telling travel stories through a combination of my
                writing, photography, and videos.</p>

            <h3>Food</h3>
            <p>I used to cook different foods for my friends at work. They started asking for the recipe. That was a
                turning point for me, So i decided to start my very own blog where i can share my recipes.</p>

            <h3>Book</h3>
            <p>I read books primarily to learn, grow, and feed my curiosities. I always feel a sense of satisfaction
                after finishing the three-step process of reading, analysing, and reviewing books for my blog posts.</p>

            <h2>Live with no excuses and travel with no regrets !</h2>
            <p>Through my passion for different cultures and people in the world, it has brought me to places that not
                many travel to and through these experiences, I was able to find a travel-style that is my own and
                allowed me to find a unique voice in this travel blog industry.

            <h2>It is better to know one book intimately than a hundred superficially !</h2>
            <p>Reading develops our brains and gives us the ability to understand life in a much better fashion. Love to
                read books across many genres in both fiction and non-fiction and want to find a great story that
                will compel readers to keep on turning those pages.</p>

            <h2>Together, let's fight against <span class="red">global warming</span> </h2>
            <p>To preserve a livable climate, greenhouse-gas emissions must be reduced to net zero by 2050. Bold, fast,
                and wide-ranging action needs to be taken by governments and businesses. But the transition to a
                low-carbon world also requires the participation of citizens – especially in advanced economies.
                ActNow is the United Nations campaign for individual action on climate change and sustainability.
                Every one of us can help limit global warming and take care of our planet. By making choices that have
                less harmful effects on the environment, we can be part of the solution and influence change.
